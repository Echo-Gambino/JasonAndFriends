# Jason And Friends #

A tool for Jason and his friends to help plan for potluck



## Purpose ##

This tool is to help myself (the developer) get familiar with using Json in C# and trying out its applications in its use. Not only that, I'm planning to have this app be helpful to those who ARE planning a potluck rather than Jason (who is fictional by the way).
